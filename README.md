To use the code in this project, you need to have R installed on your system. You can download and install R from the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, some packages used in the code may require installation. You can install them using the `install.packages()` function in R.

## Usage

The code in this project is organized into separate files and code snippets, each demonstrating a specific concept or technique in R programming. You can browse through the code files to learn about different aspects of R and data analysis. Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and learn from it.

To run the code snippets, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R, such as RStudio. Simply open the code file or copy and paste the code snippets into the R console, and execute them to see the results.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several R packages to demonstrate different functionalities. These packages are mentioned within the code files and snippets where they are used. You can install these packages using the `install.packages()` function in R.

Some of the packages used in this project include:
- palmerpenguins: for accessing the penguins dataset
- ggplot2: for data visualization
- tidyverse: a collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization
